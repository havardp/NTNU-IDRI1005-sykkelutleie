## Motivation

This project was made during my second semester for the course IDRI1005. We made an electron application for a fictionary bike rental shop. The application needed an overview of employees, customers, bikes, rentals etc. And the ability to create, delete and edit everything. The technologies used were React, [React simplified](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-simplified) (because it was made by our teacher), Electron (to serve it as a desktop application), mySQL database and a few others.

Note that since the project was based on a NTNU mysql database, it isn't possible to run the project without configuring some things.
